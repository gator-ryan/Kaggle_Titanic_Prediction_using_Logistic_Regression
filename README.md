Hey guyz, this was my attempt to the First Kaggle Competetions most of you would have solved. 
I decided to apply the most fundamental binary Classification Algorithm of Logistic Regression. The project is kept super simple without any hyperparameter tuning using gridsearchcv or randomsearchcv as I simply wanted to get a hang of how the competeions here at kaggle work.

The accuracy of my model came out to be :- 75.83 %

File Structure Explanation:- 

1. train_csv - This is the training data provided by Kaggle for training the model
2. test_csv - This is the testing data provided by kaggle for testing the model
3. submission_csv - This is my output for all the respective passengerId in the testing data ( This output format was asked by them specifically)
4. gender_scv - An axample format of the output expected by them where the model predicition is solely based on gender ( saying all females would survuve )
5. main.ipynb - The main notebook for the entire code of the model


Extensive Feature Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis is also done by me to ensure smooth training of the data.
Cheers & Have fun.
